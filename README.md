# NumPy: Numerical Computing with Python

## Overview

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is an open-source Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python and is widely used in fields like data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and engineering.

This repository provides examples and tutorials to help you learn and utilize NumPy's powerful features for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
